  <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my CS 499 ePortfolio. My name is <strong>Asadullah Zafar</strong>, and this portfolio is the culmination of my academic journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Through this site, I demonstrate my growth, technical skills, and professional capabilities developed throughout the program.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase three enhanced artifacts that highlight my proficiency in key areas of computer science: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. These artifacts reflect not only my technical expertise but also my ability to reflect, adapt, and improve based on feedback and real-world standards.</p>

  <p>Throughout the program, I’ve developed skills in collaborative software development, version control, problem solving, secure design, and project management. I’ve also gained experience working on real projects, refining existing codebases, implementing secure practices, and producing reliable, scalable, and user-centered solutions. These competencies are demonstrated across the artifacts presented in this portfolio.</p>

  <p>In addition to technical growth, I’ve honed my ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences—both technical and non-technical. My code review video and written narratives further highlight my ability to analyze, document, and explain complex systems in a professional, clear, and approachable way.</p>

  <p>I invite you to explore the navigation above to view my enhanced artifacts, code samples, and supporting documentation. Thank you for taking the time to review my work.</p>
