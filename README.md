# Asadullah Zafar â€“ CS 499 ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for **CS 499: Computer Science Capstone** at Southern New Hampshire University.

This portfolio represents the culmination of my work throughout the Computer Science program. It showcases my technical skills, development growth, and ability to apply computing principles to real-world problems across three key areas:

- Software Design and Engineering  
- Algorithms and Data Structures  
- Databases
